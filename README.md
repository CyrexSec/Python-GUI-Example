Python-GUI-Example
==================
This is the example code I used to create the GUI shown in my Macbrained presentation "Python for the Bash Scripter".

Execute this script from the command line.  Clicking the "Submit" button will display which boxes were checked or values that were input by the user into the ticket number and comment text fields.
